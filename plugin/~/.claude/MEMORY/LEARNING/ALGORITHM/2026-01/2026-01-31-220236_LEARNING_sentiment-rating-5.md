**Rating:** 5/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Neutral command requesting multi-agent approach

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

隔壁老王 is requesting the use of a multi-agent approach to solve problems, specifically asking for professional domain-specific agents with depth. This appears to be a technical instruction or request for system configuration rather than an expression of emotional sentiment toward PAI's performance. The message is directive in nature, indicating a preference for certain technical implementation (multi-agent system) without providing feedback on PAI's current behavior or expressing frustration/satisfaction. Since this is a command/request without emotional indicators related to PAI's work, no sentiment rating should be assigned.
